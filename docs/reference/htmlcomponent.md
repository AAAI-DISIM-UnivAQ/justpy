# HTML Components

## Introduction

In JustPy components are Python classes. All HTML components inherit from either the Div or Input component. The Input component itself inherits from the Div component. 

The reference will describe the Div component and the Input component. All other components inherit from them and should be self explanatory.

It would be helpful to read the [HTML Components](tutorial/html_components) chapter in the tutorial first.
